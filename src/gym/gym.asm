; Gym core - everything this project adds lives in ROM banks 2 and up.

; HRAM
;
; The original leaves exactly two bytes of HRAM free ($FFFD-$FFFE); everything
; below $FFFD is in use. hGymBank must be in HRAM because the trampoline uses
; `ldh`, and because it is touched on every bank switch.

;
; Claimed from the one large gap the original leaves: $D762-$DF6F, 2062 bytes
; between the high score tables and the audio variables. Verified unused - no
; code in the disassembly references an address in that range.
;
; NOTE: $C400 is NOT free in v1.1 (wDarkSolidBlocksUnderRandomBlocks lives
; there). An earlier draft of docs/architecture.md said otherwise, based on a
; less complete disassembly's memory map.
;
; Gym code must never write outside this range.

; cheaper cartridge, and the community intends to have carts produced.
